                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;">What's the difference between a unit with an integrated sink and a standalone hand-washing station?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">A unit with a sink offers the convenience of washing facilities inside a private, single stall. A standalone station is a separate, multi-sided unit that allows several people to wash their hands at once, making it ideal for placement near food service areas or for managing high-traffic hygiene needs.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Can your delivery trucks access remote, rural locations with unpaved roads?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Our trucks are designed for heavy-duty use, but safe access is key. We can typically navigate well-maintained gravel or dirt roads. The primary concerns are steep inclines, soft or muddy ground, and tight turns. We are happy to consult with you using an aerial map to assess the delivery route beforehand.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Do you offer a damage waiver or insurance for your rentals?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, for your peace of mind, we offer an optional damage waiver for a small additional fee. This waiver covers the cost of most accidental damages to the unit during your rental period. It does not cover theft or vandalism, which should be covered by your homeowner's or event insurance policy.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Are the chemicals you use in the toilets safe for my family and the environment?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Absolutely. We are committed to safety and sustainability. All our units are serviced with a high-quality, non-formaldehyde, biodegradable chemical that is specifically designed to neutralize odors and break down waste effectively. It is completely safe and poses no risk to people, pets, or the environment.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How is a high-rise unit serviced when it's on an upper floor?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Servicing a high-rise unit is a specialized process. Our technicians bring a smaller, portable pumping unit up to the floor via the service elevator. The waste is securely transferred into this sealed unit and then brought down to our main service truck at ground level for safe and efficient removal.</p>
